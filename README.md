## How ZeniBot Makes Decisions

###  Technical Indicators
- **MACD**: Detects momentum shifts (buy/sell signals).
- **RSI**: Identifies overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) assets.
- **SMA/EMA**: Crossover analysis to catch trends.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Measures volatility extremes.
- **Volume**: Confirms or weakens signal strength.

### On-Chain Metrics (via OKX API)
- **Liquidity Depth**: Low-liquidity tokens flagged as risky.
- **Daily Active Wallets**: Adoption signal.
- **Trading Volume**: Bullish momentum or bearish exit signal.
- **Bridge Activity**: Detects shifting yield opportunities across chains.

##  Example Suggestions

> _“MACD crossover detected on SOL with RSI at 42 — moderate momentum building.”_  
> _“High DEX volume and bullish moving average crossover on RAY — consider entering with stop-loss.”_  
> _“Your SOL allocation is 80% idle. Consider staking or deploying to LPs with rising APR.”_  
> _“Token XYZ has low liquidity and narrowing Bollinger Bands — price breakout or high risk expected.”_
